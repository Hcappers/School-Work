# PA2 LinkedList, Stacks, and Queues

**Author:** Haskell Cappers

## Description

- The purpose of the LinkedList program is to develop an empty linkedlist, and have the functionality to add to the head of the list, add at the back of the list, add at any spot in the list, search for values at any spot in the list, delete a node at the front of the list, delete a node at the back of the list, and delete a node at any spot in the list. 
- The purpose of the Stacks program is to develop a stack with the functionality to add a node at the head of the stack, delete the top node in the stack and return the value of the delete node, see the value of the node at the front of the stack, check to see if the stack is empty and to keep track of the size of the stack
- The purpose of the Queue program is to develop a queue with the functionality to add a node at the start of the queue, delete the most recently added node, get the value at the front of the queue, check to see if the queue is empty and to keep track of the size of the queue.

## Known Bugs
- Running java LinkedList.java does not work but running java LinkedList works.

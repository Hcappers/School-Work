MA305:
This course is an introduction to the Unix operating system, 
programming in Python, and the use of mathematical libraries 
for the prospective Computational Mathematics majors.  
Applications may include root-finding algorithms, numerical 
differentiation and integration, least squares, linear systems  
and first order differential equations.

Unix:
Unix is designed to keep the concept of sharing in mind. 
Multiple people can log in to the same machine at the same time and also, 
some people can log in from different locations to the same machine. 
Unix has less burden than the Windows system, is highly customizable, 
and is better secured.

Python:
Python is incredibly easy to learn and use for beginners. 
It is the most accessible among all the programming languages 
available because it has simplified syntax that is not complicated 
at all and gives more emphasis on natural language.
